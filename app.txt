Input: Rotor Dia, WTG Coords
Output: T0 Pos North of WTG +- 5m accuracy is OK

After Placing the tracker:

Input: Hub ctr (x,y,z)
Output: Exact location of WTG 



I enter a number rotor dia which is the distance im going to move according to formula 1.125D


And it takes my coords current and draws straight line length = 1.125D and gives my new coords - at the end of the line = T0

Just enter a coordinate and it gives another coordinate 1.125D meters opposite to the direction you are currently facing
Then check if you've reached the correct position.


After that enter the hub center, in x,y,z, this will be relative to the livox fov, Now give the correct posiiton to move right or left by x meters

After this the system should self correct to the current position using the pan and tilt motor to align the hub ctr with the livox center


Ok now facing the turbine normally, 
give the sp1, sp2 ,sp3 and sp4 position coordinates
plot a circle with 3*D and mark the scan positions

sp1 : blade 3 o clock pos with horizontal middle
sp2:  blade 3 o clock pos with horizontal middle, offset by 10 degree
sp3: similar and opposite to sp1
sp4: blade 9 o clock pos, opposite to sp2

Give the coords for all of this 

They should all change according to yaw with the turbine tower axis as axis of rotation, if the turbine yaw>+-10 deg




Or Model the benewake, livox and camera FOVs


Ok with the tower base as the center, and the rotor diameter i will give four position which are to be marked on the ground

sp1: positive rotorDia/4 in the positive x direction in the x axis (



Turbine facing x-axis

SP1: (Rotor_Dia/4, Rotor_Dia*1.125, 0)
SP2: (Rotor_Dia/4, Hub_ht*tan(theta), 0)
SP3: (Rotor_Dia/4, -Rotor_Dia*1.125, 0)
SP4: (Rotor_Dia/4, -Hub_ht*tan(theta), 0)
